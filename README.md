This web is a showcase of the concepts learnt in this unit (multimedia elements).

## SVG Gallery
This first section showcases a gallery of SVGs,
displayed in a carrousel.

The original SVGs have been remade for the following reasons:
- They don't match with anything, design-wise
- They were way too simple an unimpressive

The new SVGs are the logos of Suckless, the Haskell programming language, Artix Linux and Python,
and they use new concepts such as polygons, filters (fill and mask) and BÃ©zier Curves.

The carrousel has been made by hand.
You can look at its code at svgs.js.


## Audio Player
There isn't much to be said here.

I haven't used html scrollbars because I didn't know they existed.
The only thing externally imported is the Waveform in the back of the image,
which is from a javascript library.

The original player has been replaced because it didn't match with anything.
I also replaced some functions that were annoying to use,
like the volume+- buttons and the speed controllers.

The javascript is located at audio.js


## Video Player
Same thing as audio, more or less. There is nothing to say.

Go look up video.js.


## Contact Form (?)
It pops up a sweetalert alert when you submit it.
It follows the exercise's instructions, I guess.
